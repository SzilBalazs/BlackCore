# Overview

BlackCore is a neural network based chess engine developed from scratch.
Its alpha beta search uses various pruning techniques, powered by blazing fast
move generator.

## Installation

### Downloading prebuilt binary

You can download the latest release <a href="https://github.com/SzilBalazs/BlackCore/releases/latest">here</a> both for
Windows and Linux.
To select the right binary use the first instruction set that your CPU supports (doesn't crash), in the order of BMI2 ->
AVX2 -> popcnt

### Building from source (recommended)

After downloading the source, you can run the following commands, to build
a native binary.
This option gives the best performance.
**Please update your compiler before building!**

With any questions or problems feel free to create a github issue.

```
cd src
make clean build ARCH=native
```

ARCH = popcnt/avx2/bmi2/native

*If you wish to use another compiler than g++ set the CXX variable to for example clang. Warning: compatibility is not
guaranteed.*

## Usage

BlackCore in itself is a command line program, and requires a UCI compatible
Chess GUI (like <a href="https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess">Cute Chess</a>
or <a href="http://www.playwitharena.de/">Arena</a>) for the best user experience.

### UCI Options

- **Hash** - The size of the Hash table in MB.
- **Threads** - The amount of threads that can be used in the search
- **Move Overhead** - The delay (in ms) between finding the best move and the GUI reacting to it. You may want to make
  this higher if you notice that the engine often runs out of time.
- **SyzygyPath** (Optional) - The folder containing Syzygy tablebases.
- **EvalFile** (Optional) - The file containing the neural network which should be use. If it isn't found BlackCore will
  use the embedded network.

## NNUE Ethics

As of v2.0 BlackCore uses neural networks for the evaluation of positions with support for AVX2 vectorization.
There is no need to worry about installing networks separately as they are embedded using incbin. Every net
was trained by me with training code which <a href="https://github.com/SzilBalazs/CoreTrainer">I wrote</a>.
Unfortunately I lack the hardware resources which are needed
to generate data, which means that external engines are used for that purpose. In my opinion this requires
transparency about the origins of the training data and acknowledgement of these engines.

### <a href="https://github.com/jhonnold/berserk">Berserk</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jhonnold">Jay Honnold</a>

Berserk is very strong chess engine that generated the training data with the contribution of Shaheryar Sohail which
were used continuously throughout v2.0-v5.0.

### <a href="https://lczero.org/">Leela Chess Zero</a> by The LC0 Team

LC0 uses a different approach for playing high level chess. It's powered by MCTS and acquired all of her chess knowledge
by selfplay.
Since v6.0-dev BlackCore uses data from <a href="https://storage.lczero.org/files/training_data/"> here</a>, which is
licensed under <a href="https://storage.lczero.org/files/training_data/LICENSE.txt">Open Database License</a>.
